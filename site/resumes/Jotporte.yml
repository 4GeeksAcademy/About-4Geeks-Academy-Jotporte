        As an Amazon customer service associate, he learned how to prevent problems, resolve queries, and remove customers. I have had to serve customers in both English and Spanish whether by phone, chat or email, this includes everything from orders, deliveries, product questions, to payment issues and website guidance. You learned to use a variety of tools to navigate, research, review solutions, and communicate effectively with internal and external customers and Amazon business partners. I am also responsible for gathering intelligence to prevent potential issues that may affect the customer experience and delivery performance.
